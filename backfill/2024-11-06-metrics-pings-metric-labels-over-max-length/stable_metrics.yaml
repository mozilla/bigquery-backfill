'shown_old_session', 'shown_only_about_welcomeback', 'shown_many_crashes', 'shown_many_crashes_old_session' all indicate we did show the interstitial because of a crash, and the text after 'shown' indicates what secondary reason there was to show this page (as we don't show it for 'just' one crash).

"dump_match", "cache_match" and "remote_match" are expected known-good values, and means that the loaded bloomfilter matches the blocklist record in the RemoteSettings collection.

"dump_fallback" and "cache_fallback" means that the last known bloomfilter was used, despite it not matching the latest record in the RemoteSettings collection. In this case the outdated bloomfilter is used as a fallback (e.g. because the latest version cannot be downloaded). "unknown"  means that the bloomfilter cannot be loaded at all.

            The total amount of time that we could reasonably be checkerboarding. This is the union of two possibly-intersecting sets of time periods: The first set is that in which checkerboarding was actually happening, since by definition it could potentially be happening. The second set is that in which the APZC is actively transforming content in the compositor, since it could potentially transform it so as to display checkerboarding to the user. Combined with other information, this allows us to meaningfully say how frequently users actually enncounters checkerboarding. (Migrated from the geckoview metric of the same name).

            Time it took for the parent process to prepare a Datastore. This duration can be significantly affected by Datastore preloading, which is triggered when a page begins to load. When a Datastore is already preloaded, the preparation is usually fast since it doesn't need to do any I/O. If an error occurs, the time is not recorded. In future, we might want to introduce additional separate metrics for different types of datastore preparations (data needs to be loaded from disk, data already available, etc.)

            This metric logs the count of directory entries iterated within the QuotaManager::InitializeRepository function for each repository type. Each instance of this metric is labeled with one of three repository types: "persistent", "temporary" or "default" (there's also "private" repository but that should never be iterated by the function). The main purpose is to track and analyze iteration counts during the initialization process of each repository type, helping to identify performance trends or potential inefficiencies across these repositories. This can provide insight into the impacts of specific code changes, including potential optimizations or regressions.
