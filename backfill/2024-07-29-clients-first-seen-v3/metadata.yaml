friendly_name: Clients First Seen v3 backfill
description: |-
  The metadata here is to be used in conjunction with the clients_first_seen_v3
  backfill. The table is partitioned, but does not get written over each time the script
  runs nor does it depend on the past as the query.sql pulls data from clients_first_seen_v2
  and combines it with specific columns that were either not added in clients_first_seen_v2
  or there were errors (normalized_os)
